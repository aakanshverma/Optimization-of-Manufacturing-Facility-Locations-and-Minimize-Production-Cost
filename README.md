# Optimization-of-Manufacturing-Facility-Locations-and-Minimize-Production-Cost
Date: May'24 - June'24<br>

 This report presents a mathematical modeling approach to solving the
 Capacitated Plant Location Problem (CPLP) in supply chain optimiza
tion. The goal is to minimize the total costs associated with operating
 plants and shipping goods between locations. This includes both fixed
 costs of opening plants and variable costs of transportation.
